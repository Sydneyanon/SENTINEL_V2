# Ralph - Prometheus Bot Optimizer

**Single-Task Autonomous Agent**

## Current Status

**Active Task**: See `CURRENT_TASK.md`  
**Mode**: Single-task focus (one optimization at a time)

## How It Works

Ralph works on **ONE task at a time** assigned by a human.

✅ Makes focused code changes  
✅ Tests and monitors results  
✅ Reports findings  
❌ Does NOT pick tasks autonomously  
❌ Does NOT work on multiple things simultaneously

- ✅ OPT-024: Conviction threshold 75 (quality over quantity)
- ✅ OPT-023: Emergency stop filters (rug prevention)
