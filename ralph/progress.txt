# Ralph Progress Log - Prometheus Bot Optimization
Started: Not yet run
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Bot auto-deploys to Railway when pushing to `main` branch
- Conviction scoring happens in scoring/conviction_engine.py
- Config values are in config.py
- KOL wallet list is in data/curated_wallets.py
- Database metrics available via database.py methods
- Helius API credit usage: ~10 credits per holder check, cached for 60min

## Metrics Collection
- Use `python ralph/collect_metrics.py --duration 120` to collect 2-hour metrics
- Baseline metrics stored in prd.json under each optimization
- Compare with `--compare OPT-ID` flag

## Deployment Notes
- Push to feature branch first
- Create PR and merge to main to trigger Railway deploy
- Wait ~2 min for deployment
- Monitor Railway logs for errors
