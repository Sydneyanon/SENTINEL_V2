## 2026-01-24 21:47 UTC - EMERGENCY: OPT-024 REVERTED (Conviction Threshold)

### Critical Finding: Bot Essentially Dead
**Analysis Period:** 2026-01-24 00:00 - 21:46 UTC (21.75 hours)

### Metrics (Last 24h)
**Signal Volume:**
- signals_posted: 2 (0.08/hour - 1 per 12 hours!)
- Conviction scores: 75.0 (posted), 45.0 (posted before OPT-024)
- Target was ~50% fewer signals, got ~98% fewer

**Activity Tracked:**
- KOL buys: 2,116 from 33 unique KOLs
- Unique tokens checked: 634
- Helius credits used: ~6,340

**Score Distribution:**
- 75+: 1 signal (0.16% of tokens)
- 45-54: 1 signal (0.16% of tokens)
- Lower: 632 tokens (99.68%)

### Root Cause Analysis
OPT-024 raised threshold from 45 → 75 for "quality over quantity"
- Intent: ~50% reduction in signals, higher win rate
- Reality: ~98% reduction (2 signals vs expected ~100/day baseline)
- Threshold 75 is unreachable by current scoring algorithm
- Only 1 token hit exactly 75.0 in entire 24h period

### AGGRESSIVE MODE Override Decision: REVERT
**Cannot achieve 75% win rate with zero signals to measure!**

Reasoning:
1. **Volume crisis:** Need 5-10 signals/day minimum for win rate calculation
2. **Optimization paralysis:** Can't optimize what we can't measure
3. **Filters working:** OPT-023 (emergency stop) + OPT-036 (data quality) already preventing rugs
4. **Threshold miscalibration:** 75 was set without score distribution analysis

### Changes Made
**Config Change:** MIN_CONVICTION_SCORE: 75 → 55
**Commit:** bcabb00
**Deployed:** 2026-01-24 21:47 UTC (Railway auto-deploy)

**New Thresholds:**
- MIN_CONVICTION_SCORE: 55 (pre-graduation)
- POST_GRAD_THRESHOLD: 60 (post-graduation)

**Expected Impact:**
- Signal volume: 5-15 signals/day (manageable, measurable)
- Quality maintained by: OPT-023 emergency filters + OPT-036 data quality checks
- Allows performance measurement for future optimizations

### Monitoring Plan
- Watch for 6 hours post-deploy (until 2026-01-25 03:47 UTC)
- Target: 3-8 signals in 6 hours (0.5-1.3/hour)
- Track: conviction score distribution, signal quality, rug rate

### Learnings
1. **NEVER set thresholds without score distribution analysis**
2. **Quality AND volume matter** - can't measure quality without volume
3. **AGGRESSIVE MODE needs signals** - 75% WR of 0 signals = meaningless
4. **Multi-layer filtering works** - OPT-023 + OPT-036 already handle quality

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Monitor OPT-024 revert (threshold 55) for 6h
2. ⏳ Evaluate OPT-002 (cache optimization) - monitoring ended
3. ⏳ Evaluate OPT-035 (speed optimization) - monitoring ended
4. ⏳ Wait for OPT-041 (credit optimization) - 6h remaining
